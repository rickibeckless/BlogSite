Blog website showcasing CSS styling using flexbox and grid.

Created as a project of Udacity's Frontend Web Development Fundamentals Nanodegree program, this website serves as a showcase of my progression of skills in web development. 
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in HTML, CSS, CSS Grid and Flexbox, and responsive design. 
Key features of this website include Grid and Flexbox used simultaneously and a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
